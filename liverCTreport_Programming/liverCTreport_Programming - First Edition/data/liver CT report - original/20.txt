¿À¨d∂µ•ÿ: CT of Liver w/o Contrast 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
This study has been compared with the previous study on 20190130 
Liver CT without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies 
Techniques: [Total image number:379][this study is not optimal for evaluation of abdominal hallow organs; mucoal lesion of GI tract cannot be well evaluated in routine abdominal CT study due to difficulty in optimal preparation of the whole GI tract; scopy or barium study may be better modalities.] 
 From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section  
 Contrast agent -(body weight+20)ml of contrast medium injected at 2ml/sec, 30 sec after initiation of injection, starting arterial phase scan; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase scan; and venous phase scan began in 20 sec after the end of the portal phase scan and scanning from lower chest to pelvis level. 
Findings: 
Small amount of right pleural effusion and pericardial effusion 
Atelectasis over RLL lung region 
Mild infiltration over left lower lung field,   
Exophytic mass (about 55mm) over gastric antrum portion; with multple enlarged LNs over perigastric , peri-pancreatic, para-caval, paraaortic regions 
Numerous hepatic masses (=°q37mm) without early enhancement 
No definite  biliary dilatation 
No hydronephrosis,   
Left renal cysts 
Left adrenal nodule (9-10mm) 
Focal collaspe at the visualized  colon; colonic annular lesion(s) can not be excluded by CT imaging 
No definite pneumoperitoneum is seen.   
Ascites with increased mesenteric strandings; nature to be determined. 
Calcified plaque(s) on  coronary arterial wall 
 
IMP: 
[1]Suspecting gastric cancer with LN, hepatic metastasis 
[2]Ascites with increased mesenteric strandings; nature to be determined.
