¿À¨d∂µ•ÿ: CT of Liver w/o Contrast 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Liver CT without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies:  
 
This study has been compared to previous CT on 20181022 
 
Findings:  
 
Progressive change in size and number of small metastatic nodules (2-6 mm --°r 3-9 mm) in RML, and bil LL compared to last study 20181121. 
Pulmonary infiltration in bilateral lower lungs.  
A strongly enhanced nodule in LLS liver (6 mm), favoring hepatic hemangioma 
S/P RFA with necrotic areas at S5 liver (2.5 & 2.2 cm) and LLS (1.2 cm).  
Multiple newfound metastatic nodules in S5 (11 mm), S8 (4 mm) and S6 (6mm, 8mm & 8mm) LLS (7mm  10 mm)  
Patency of portal vein.  
No definite biliary dilatation. 
Gallstones in collapsed gallbladder.  
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
s/p radical subtotal colectomy, partial resection of small bowel. 
Suspicious bone destruction over left iliac wing, no significant interval change.  
Normal function and contour of both kidneys.  
Patency of bilateral ureters.  
No definite adrenal nodule.   
Several newfound peritoneal and mesenteric nodules (8-16 mm), favoring metastatic implants 
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.
