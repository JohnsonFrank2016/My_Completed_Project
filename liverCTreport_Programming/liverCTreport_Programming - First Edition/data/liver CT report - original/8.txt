¿À¨d∂µ•ÿ: CT of Liver w/o Contrast 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Brief Hx: HCCs s/p OP recurrence s/p RFA f/u 
This stdy has been compared to the previous study   
CT of the liver with pre-contrast & triphasic contrast enhancement studies show:   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast agent injected at 2ml/sec, 30 sec after initiation of injection, starting arterial phase scan; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase scan; and venous phase scan began in 20 sec after the end of portal phase scan 
Findings: 
Atelectasis or fibrotic band over left ligular lobe  
s/p right hepatectomy and cholecystectomy  
s/p RFA over recurrent HCCs in S4, LLS and S8 with necrotic changes 
S/P TAE with dense lipiodol stasis over S8 liver tumor (2cm) but with incomplete treatment(1.3cm viable part) 
No other early enhanced liver nodule  over the rest of the liver 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas 
Mild splenomegaly 
No definite biliary dilatation s/p cholecystectomy 
Patency of portal veins   
Thickening of medial limb of left adrenal gland, no interval change 
Left renal cyst 2.0 cm 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys, no hydronephrosis 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
IMP: 
s/p right hepatectomy and cholecystectomy  
s/p RFA over recurrent HCCs in S4, LLS and S8 with necrotic changes 
S/P TAE with dense lipiodol stasis over S8 liver tumor (2cm) but with incomplete treatment (1.3cm viable part)
