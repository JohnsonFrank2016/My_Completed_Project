¿À¨d∂µ•ÿ: CT of Liver w/o Contrast 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Brief Hx: LC, liver nodules 
This study has been compared to the previous study at 2018.11.23 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Ill-defined early enhanced liver masses in S4 (3.5cm) and S8 (1.7cm) with early washout, favor HCCs 
Thrombosis of the portal veins r/o tumor invasion 
Marked splenomegaly and varices 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
Mild ascites 
No right hydronephrosis 
s/p left nephrectomy, focal post stranding and small fluid collection (2.8cm) 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly, varices and ascites 
Infiltrated early enhanced liver tumors in S4 and S8 with portal thrombosis 
s/p left nephrectomy, focal post stranding and small fluid collection (2.8cm)
