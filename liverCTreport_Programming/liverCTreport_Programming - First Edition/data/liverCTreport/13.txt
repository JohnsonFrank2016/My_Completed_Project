¿À¨d∂µ•ÿ: CT of Liver w/o Contrast 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Brief Hx: LC liver nodules 
This study has been compared to the previous study   
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
S/P RFA with tissue necrosis over S8 (3.8cm), S4 (2.1cm) and S6 (3cm) of the liver 
1.27cm non-enhanced ndoules over S4 liver 
No other early enhanced liver nodule over the rest of the liver 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, but gallstones noted 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and gallstones 
S/P RFA with tissue necrosis over S8 (3.8cm), S4 (2.1cm) and S6 (3cm) of the liver 
1.27cm non-enhanced ndoules over S4 liver, regnerative nodule
