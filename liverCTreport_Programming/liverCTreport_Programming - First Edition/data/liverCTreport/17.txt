¿À¨d∂µ•ÿ: CT of Liver w/o Contrast 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Brief Hx: HCC post RFA, post Tx AFP:10-°r813, suspect HCC recurrence 
 
This study has been compared to the previous study at 2018.04.03 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
s/p TAE with lipiodol stasis in S8 but focal ill-defined hypodense masses in S7-8 with early enhance and washout, size up to 3.6cm, favor recurrent tumors 
Patency of the portal veins but thrombosis of ant. RPV due to tumor invasion 
Moderate splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, but gallstones are noted 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
Massive ascites 
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites 
s/p TAE with lipiodol stasis in S8 
Viable recurrent HCCs in S7-8 (buggest 3.6cm) with right portal invasion
