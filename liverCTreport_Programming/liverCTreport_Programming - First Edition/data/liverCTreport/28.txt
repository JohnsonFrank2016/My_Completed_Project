CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies 
 
Brief Hx: HCC s/p op, recurrence s/p TAE f/u 
This study has been compared to the previous study on 20181225 
   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
 
Findings: 
Mild right pleural effusion 
s/p extended right hepatectomy and cholecstectomy 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.   
s/p TAE and  Echo-guided percutaneous ethanol injection for HCC 
Three early enhance nodules in LLS liver (1.64cm,8.3mm,5.7mm) 
Patency of the portal vein  
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
Splenomegaly 
No diliatation of biliary tree 
Bil. renal cysts 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
No hydronephrosis  
No obvious bony destruction detected   
Minimal ascites in pelvic cavity 
 
IMP: 
1. s/p extended right hepatectomy and cholecstectomy 
2. Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly 
3. s/p TAE and  Echo-guided percutaneous ethanol injection for HCC 
4. Three early enhance nodules in LLS liver (1.64cm,8.3mm,5.7mm), may due to recurrent tumors
