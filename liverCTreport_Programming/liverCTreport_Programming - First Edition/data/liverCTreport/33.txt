CT of the liver with pre-contrast & triphasic contrast enhancement studies show:   
 
This study has been compared to the previous study on 20190312 
 
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected at 2ml/sec, 30 sec after initiation of injection, starting arterial phase scan; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase scan; and venous phase scan began in 20 sec after the end of portal phase scan 
Findings: 
 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver is compatible with liver cirrhosis 
S/P RFA with necrotic areas at S4 (4.1 cm) and S8 liver (1.1 cm).  
No definite enhanced liver tumor noted.  
Metallic clips in S7 liver  
No definite space occupying lesion in the liver, spleen and pancreas. 
No definite biliary dilatation 
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
Patency of portal vein   
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys, no hydronephrosis 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
Linear calcification of abdominal aorta & iliac aa  . 
Left renal stone (5 mm), but no definite hydronephrosis  
Compression fracture of L3 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.
