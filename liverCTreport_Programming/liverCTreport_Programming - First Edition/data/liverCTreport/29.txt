Computed Tomography of Liver With and Without Enhancement Show: 
**No previous study on CGMH PACS for comparison 
 
Findings:   
No pericardial effusion 
Atherosclerotic plaques on the visualized aortic,  arterial wall(s) 
No definite pulmonary nodule in visual field. 
One 7.7x7.1cm enhanced mass in LLS liver with contrast medium washout, maybe HCC, complicated with hyperdense fluid collection around tumor and perihepatic region, possible rupture with hemoperitoneum 
Two 1.4cm soft tissue density lesion in LUQ, maybe seeding tumor 
One 7.4x4.8cm multiple cystic mass with internal thickened enhanced septum in left lobe liver, nature to bedetermined, DDX: HCC mixed cholangiocarcinoma. 
Two well defined hypodense nodules in right lobe liver, due to liver cyst or also cystic mass? 
No definite space occupying lesion in the  spleen and pancreas. 
Unremarkable gallbladder. 
Patency of portal vein  
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
No adrenal nodules 
Multiple small visible porta hepatis, periceliac LNs 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
Ascites 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
Focal collaspe at the visualized  colon; colonic annular lesion(s) can not be  
excluded by the examination. 
No definite destructive bony lesion 
 
IMP: 
* Favoring LLS HCC complicated with hyperdense fluid collection around tumor and perihepatic region, possible rupture with hemoperitoneum. 
* Another multiple cystic mass in LLS liver,  DDX: HCC mixed cholangiocarcinoma, abscess. 
* Soft tissue density lesion in LUQ, maybe seeding tumor
