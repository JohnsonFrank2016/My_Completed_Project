Computed Tomography of Liver With and Without Enhancement Show: 
 
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section  
Contrast agent at 2ml/sec, 30 sec  
Scanning including the arterial phase, portal phase and venous phase are performed 
Coronal reconstructions are also done 
 
Findings: 
Mild infiltration and focal atelectasis in bil. lower lungs. 
Calcified coronary arteries.  
Calcified atherosclerotic plaques of the visualized aorta and arteries.  
Enlarged supradiphragmatic LN (1.4 x 1.0 cm). 
Multiple masses over bilobar liver (up to 9.2 cm in S4-LLS), favoring HCCs. 
Tumor invasion to LPV, IVC, LHV and MHV with venous thrombosis. 
S/P TAE with most embolizer retention in S1 and right liver.  
Progressive change of hemoperitoneum, suspicious for recurrent HCC rupture. 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
Unremarkable gallbladder. 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
No definite adrenal mass.  
No definite obstructive uropathy.  
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs.  
Calcified uterine masses (up to 5.0 cm), possibly due to myomas. 
Degenerative change of lumbar spine with spurs formation amd interspace narrowing. 
Osteolytic lesion over right iliac bone, favor metastasis.
