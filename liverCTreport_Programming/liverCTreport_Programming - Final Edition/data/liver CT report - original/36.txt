CT of the liver with pre-contrast & triphasic contrast enhancement studies show:   
Brief Hx: HCCs s/p OP recurrence s/p RFA f/u 
This study has been compared to the previous study on 20190201 
 
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast agent injected at 2ml/sec, 30 sec after initiation of injection, starting arterial phase scan; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase scan; and venous phase scan began in 20 sec after the end of portal phase scan 
 
Findings: 
Atelectasis or fibrotic band over RML and left ligular lobe  
s/p right hepatectomy and cholecystectomy  
s/p RFA over recurrent HCCs in S4, LLS with necrotic changes 
s/p TAE with dense lipiodol stasis over S4 liver tumor (1.9cm)  
Some lipiodol stains retention in high S4 liver 
No other early enhanced liver nodule  over the rest of the liver 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas 
Mild splenomegaly 
No definite biliary dilatation, s/p cholecystectomy 
Patency of portal veins   
Thickening of medial limb of left adrenal gland, no interval change 
Left renal cyst 2.0 cm 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys, no hydronephrosis 
Mild thickening of left lateral wall of urinary bladder 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen
