This study has been compared to the previous study   
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
 
Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis
