CT of the liver with pre-contrast & triphasic contrast enhancement studies show:   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section  
Contrast agent -100ml of contrast medium injected at 2ml/sec, 30 sec after initiation of injection, starting arterial phase scan; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase scan; and venous phase scan began in 20 sec after the end of portal phase scan 
 
Findings: 
Multiple enhanced liver nodules, the biggest one 4.19cm in S6, favoring liver metastasis 
Post-operative change of water-bag augmentation maommoplasty of the right breast  
RLL pulmonary nodule(3.6mm) 
Relative low density of liver with good visualization of venous system compatible with fatty liver  . 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder  
Patency of portal vein   
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  .
