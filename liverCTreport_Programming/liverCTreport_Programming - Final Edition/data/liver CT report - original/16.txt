------------------------------------------------------------ 
Brief Hx: Liver hyperechoic tumor, 2.9cm at S7-8 
 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
Findings: 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver  
Two tiny liver cysts in S4 (1cm) and S8 (0.8cm) 
One hypodense liver nodule about 2.8cm in S8 near IVC with mild peripheral enhancement, nature may be hemangioma or other (ill-defined and not typical enhancement) 
No obvious focal liver nodule 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, but gallstone is noted 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis
