Liver CT without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies:  
 
No previous CT to be compared.  
Findings:  
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
Numerous hypodense nodules without definite enhancement in the liver, favoring regenerative nodules.

No definite enhanced liver tumor noted.  
Patency of portal vein.  
No definite biliary dilatation.  
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.

IMP:  
* Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly.  
* Numerous hypodense nodules without definite enhancement in the liver, favoring regenerative nodules. 
* No definite enhanced liver tumor noted.
