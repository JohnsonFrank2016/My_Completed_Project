¿À¨d∂µ•ÿ: CT of Liver w/o Contrast 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
This study has been compared to the previous study at 20181015 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
 
Findings: 
Elevation of right hemidiaphragm 
Regressive change of the ground-glass opacity in LUL (1.4-°r1.1 cm). 
Mosaic attenuation in the lung. 
Two new acinar nodules, upto 0.5 cm, in the superior LLL, inflammation? 
Plate atelectasis in bil. LLs. 
Calcification of mitral valve.  
Stable small right cardiophrenic LN. 
Liver cirrhosis and mild splenomegaly. 
s/p segmental hepatectomy (S6 and S7 and partial S8)  
s/p RFA with hypodense area of necrosis in both lobes liver (1.5-3.6 cm).  
s/p TACE with lipiodol stasis in the S4-8 
No early enhancing and washout lesion in the liver. 
A 0.7 cm hypodense nodule at the S3 liver surface without early enhancement. 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Patency of the portal veins, no evident portal thrombosis 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas and spleen 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs   
Multiple prominent mesenteric LNs, but °q 1cm. 
No definite obstructive uropathy   
Degenerative change of the TL spine with spur formation   
No apparent bone destruction

1. Regressive change of the ground-glass opacity in LUL (1.4-°r1.1 cm). 
2. Two new acinar nodules, upto 0.5 cm, in the superior LLL, inflammation? 
3. Post treatment of the liver; No early enhancing and washout lesion in the liver.
