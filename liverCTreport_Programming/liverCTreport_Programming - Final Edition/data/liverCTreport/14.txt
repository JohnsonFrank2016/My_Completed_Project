¿À¨d∂µ•ÿ: CT of Liver w/o Contrast 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Brief Hx: HCC s/p TAE, S7 recurrence s/p RFA f/u 
This study has been compared to the previous study at 2018.10.08 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver is compatible with liver cirrhosis. 
s/p TAE with dense lipiodol stasis in S7 and S8 liver 
s/p RFA with hypodense necrotic change in both lobes 
One early enhanced liver nodule about 1.4cm in S6-7 with early washout, favor viable recurrent tumor 
No biliary tree dilatation but contracted GB with gallstones is noted 
Moderate splenomegaly 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas 
Patency of portal veins  
Small ascites at right subphrenic region. 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys, no hydronephrosis 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs   
Small umbilical hernia over umbilical portion noted with omentum in the sac. 
Degenerative change of the TL spine with spur formation  
No evident bone destruction   
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly. 
s/p TAE with dense lipiodol stasis in S7 and S8 liver 
s/p RFA with hypodense necrotic change in both lobes of liver 
One early enhanced liver nodule about 1.4cm in S6-7 with early washout, favor viable recurrent tumor
