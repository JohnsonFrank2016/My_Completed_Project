CT of the liver with pre-contrast & triphasic contrast enhancement studies show:   
 
Techniques:  
From lower chest to lower pelvis in 5-mm contiguous section for preenhanced CT 
From lower chest to lower pelvis in 5-mm contiguous section for enhanced CT (liver with arterial, portal and late phases) 
Coronal reconstructions are also done 
This study has been compared with previous study on 20181211 
 
Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
s/p RFA with tissue necrosis over S4 liver (3.1 cm) and S4/8 liver (3 cm). 
An early enhance tumor(2.42cm) around the prior RFAed S4-8 tumor near surface 
Another early enhance and early washout nodule(1.36cm) in high S4 liver 
Progression of enlarged LNs over portocaval(3.6cm to 5.4cm) and gastrohepatic (1.4cm to 2.1cm) regions 
Regressive change of LPV partial thrombus 
Patency of the main portal vein, prominent gastric and esophageal varices 
Mild splenomegaly 
A 2.5 cm juxtapapillary diverticulum  
Gallstones without apparent inflammatory change of GB  
No definite biliary dilatation 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
Compression fracture of L4. 
Compression fracture s/p vertebroplasty of L2. 
 
IMP: 
1. Liver cirrhosis with mild splenomegaly 
2. s/p RFA with tissue necrosis over S4 liver (3.1 cm) and S4/8 liver (3 cm). 
3. Favor recurrent HCCs in S4-8 liver(2.42cm) around the prior RFAed tumor and in high S4 liver(1.36cm) 
4. Progression of enlarged LNs over portocaval(5.4cm) and gastrohepatic (2.1cm) regions 
5. Regressive change of LPV partial thrombus
