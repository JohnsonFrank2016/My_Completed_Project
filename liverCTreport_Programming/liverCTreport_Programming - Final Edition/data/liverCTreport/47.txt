Findings:   
 
Findings: 
A 1 mm pleural nodule at RML. 
Stable 0.5 cm right pericardial LN. 
Calcification of mitral valve.  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
Splenomegaly   
s/p TAE with lipodol stasis in right liber. 
s/p PEI or RFA with necrotic change (0.9-2.2cm) in bil. lobes of liver. 
Multiple hypodense lesions (0.7-1.2 cm) without definite enhancement in both lobe liver may be due to regenerative nodules and post treatment change. 
Two questionable early enhanced nodules but with washout in the S7 (1.6 cm) and S8 (1.3 cm) liver, worrisome for recurrence. 
Gallstones without apparent inflammatory change of GB  
No definite biliary dilatation 
Patent portal veins 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen, no ascites 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
No definite hydronephrosis. 
Left renal or caliceal stone. 
Enlarged prostate. 
No apparent bone destruction  
Right coxa magna.
