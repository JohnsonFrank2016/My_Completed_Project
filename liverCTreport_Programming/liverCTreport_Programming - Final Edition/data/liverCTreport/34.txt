Liver CT without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies:  
 
Brief Hx: LC, HCC s/p TAE 
This study has been compared to the previous study at 20180516 
 
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
Findings: 
 
Bilateral minimal pleural effusion  
s/p sclerotherapy of esophageal varices. 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
s/p RFA with hypodense necrotic change in S4 & S8 
s/p TAE with dense lipiodol stasis in S8 
A 16 mm newfound early enhanced nodule noted in S4 liver, favoring recurrent HCC. 
No obvious focal liver nodule 
Patency of the portal veins 
Moderate splenomegaly and varices 
Mild ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, but gallstone noted 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and gallstones 
s/p RFA & PEI with hypodense necrotic change in S4 & S8 
s/p TAE with dense lipiodol stasis in S8 
A 16 mm newfound early enhanced nodule noted in S4 liver, favoring recurrent HCC.
