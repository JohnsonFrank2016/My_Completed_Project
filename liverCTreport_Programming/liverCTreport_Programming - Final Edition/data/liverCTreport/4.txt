¿À¨d∂µ•ÿ: CT of Liver w/o Contrast 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Liver CT without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies:  
 
This study has been compared to previous CT on 20181015 
 
Techniques:  
  From lower chest to pubic edge in 5-mm contiguous section  
  Contrast agent  at 2ml/sec, 30 sec  
  Scanning including  the arterial phase and delayed phase are performed 
 
Findings:   
 
No pericardial effusion 
No definite pulmonary nodule in visual field. 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  
Moderate splenomegaly 
s/p RFA with multifocal necrosis in bil. lobes of liver. 
Early enhancing nodules with early washout noted in S2(2.8cm), S8(0.9cm, 1.2cm) and S6(1.8cm and 2.5cm) liver, favoring recurrent HCCs 
Focal dilatation of LLS IHDs. 
Gallstones (up to 1.0 cm) without definite wall-thickening of gallbladder.  
Complete thrombus of right PV and partial mural thrombus over MPV. 
No definite space occupied lesion in pancreas and spleen 
Small visible celiac LN and portahpatis LN 
No definite obstructive uropathy. 
No adrenal nodules 
Enlarged prostate gland  
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  .  
Linear calcification of aorta and its major branches 
Esophageal varices. 
No definite destructive bony lesion 
 
IMP: 
* Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly with varices.
